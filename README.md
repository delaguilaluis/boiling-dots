## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Spring](https://react-spring.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - Design System

### What I learned

- Improve my understanding of React's useState and useEffect, the rendering
  lifecycle and its interaction when using timers.
- Usage of react-spring (and how amazing it is!).

### Continued development

- Areas that I want to continue be focusing on in future projects:
  - Timers interaction with useEffect
